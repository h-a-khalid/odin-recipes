    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a Macro-Friendly plate of Steak and Potatoes with Vegetables! I like to add Ketchup for simplicity but if you're not worried about the calories you can add any sauce/garnish you like! Low in fat and high in Protein this makes the perfect recipe for anyone looking to reduce calories and hit the gym!</p>
