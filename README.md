# odin-recipes

This is my first HTML Project, Hassan's Cookbook I've made a website detailing my favourite macro-friendly recipes.

 I've learnt how to use and structure basic HTML for websites, becoming comfortable with git and writing good commit messages. I also learnt the value of writing clean, contained code for ease of understanding and applying CSS rules.
